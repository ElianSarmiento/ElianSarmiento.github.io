    <h1> This is my still life.</h1>
    <p> My still life image displays what i do when i have free time in my house, i sit in a desk using my laptop doing homework and having a pile of textbooks next to me and having a pen next to me writing out homework that requires hadnwritten work. The door in the back signifies me leaving my house to get ready to go to work after school and repeating the process again.</p>
