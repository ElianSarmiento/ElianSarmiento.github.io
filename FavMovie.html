<h1> My Favorite Movie </h1>
<h2> Irong Giant </h2>


    <p> The movie is about a kid named Hogarth who encounters a meteor falling from the sky and landing next to a power line and it turned out to be a giant talking robot who needed help from getting electrocuted from the power line so Hogarth shuts the power down to save him. Later on the government discovers about the robot and tries to destroy him because he might reak havic to the town. But a agent accidently lets a nuke go off in the town, but the iron giant sacrifices himself to fly to the nuke to let it go off on him in the sky and becomes a symbol of peace in the town. </p>

    <p> the reason why i like this movie is because its on the first movies i ever watched when i was growing up on DVD, most of it is nostalgic when i watch it from time to time. The Animation in the film is one of the best for its time it released in 1999. I enjoyed the story of how a kid wanted to be friends with a giant talking robot and the comedy it sometime showed when they would both bond. </p>

    <p> The reason people should see this film is because it shows the mind of how the government see's a potential threat and wants to wipe it out without even approaching the situation which it might lead to symbolizing an issue at that time. But when i first watched it i just saw it as a family gathering movie that can be enjoyed watching around friends and family sharing a laugh and then shedding a tear at the end of the movie. </p>
