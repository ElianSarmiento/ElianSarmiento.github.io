      <h1> Bio about me</h1>
      
      <p> I'am 19 years old born in queens. I grew up mostly playing video games and hanging out with my friends outside my house almost every day. Later on during middle and high school I learned how fix and repair computer software and hardware which helped me gained a better understanding on something i use on a daily basis. My career ambition in life is having a career in game development because i was always curious on the process of game development in the studio itself.</p>
