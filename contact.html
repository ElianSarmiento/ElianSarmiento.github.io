      <h1> Statement</h1>
      
      <p> My work explores either animation or just still images of things i like to create. I am essentially interested in creating little projects that catches the audience's attention and make them be interested in the idea or subject of what I made. My work explores areas around animation or image manipulation via photoshop for images or using blender for animation. I always had a liking to realistic visuals in animations and in video games such as the recent God Of War having almost close to realistic rendering in their cutscenes and in their gameplay.   </p>
