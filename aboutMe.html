      <h1> Bio about me</h1>
      
      <p> I'am 19 years old born in queens. I grew up mostly playing video games and hanging out with my friends outside my house almost every day. Later on during middle and high school i got into comic books because of watching marvel movies and gained a whole new interest of marvel comics. Also got introduced into anime which i knew about dragon ball by watching clips of it on youtube when i was younger. My career ambition in life is having a career in game development because i was always curious on the process of game development in the studio.</p>
