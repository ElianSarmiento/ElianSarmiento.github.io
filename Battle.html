        <strong>
            Jon Snow has the wildlings with him and some of Davos army to defeat Ramsey with a giant on his side. But Ramsey numbers are greater than Jon and the action that happens is almost Realistic to the point of the horses falling and getting killed. All seems lost when the ramsey army are corning Jons army in a circle ready to stab all of them in a tight circle but Sansa Tells Littlefinger to save Jon and his army with the army of the tully that actully saved them from death. They get to the castle and finally takes it back from Ramsey, and we get to see the satisfying death of Ramseys dog feasting on his body with all the crimes and terrible things he did to people.
