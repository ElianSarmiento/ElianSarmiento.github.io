      <h1> My favorite music group</h1>
      <h2> Linkin park </h2>
      <p> One of my favorite music groups to listen to is linkin park because i like the genre of songs they make which is rock, sometimes heavy rap rock. I would usually listen "in the end" and "new divide" because its usually is nostalgic to listen back to and because its an actuall great song and has espicially deep meaning in the end when i searched the meaning of the song when they first made in early 2000's. I stopped listening to them after 2010 because there songs became very similar and started to appease to songs that came out around that time which is usually about love. The market became oversaturated with love songs and i lost touch with the band after that.
