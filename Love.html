<p> How Game Of Thrones Became One Of My Favorite Shows </p>
  </div>
<main>
    <p> <strong>I First Got into Game of thrones because of a freind i know that always bugs me for watching the show but always thought it was overrated but, until i rewatched all the lord of the rings movies and after finished return of the king i got itch to watch something medieval time that was great. So i started watching it because it was set on a similar time of the lord of the rings setting. </strong>
