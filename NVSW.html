        <p><strong> The episode that was the most interesting episode to watch because of the story progressing and the character finally meeting again because of the story leading up to it. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>  When Ygritte tries to lead the wildlings with the cannibals over the wall to take over castle black and kill all the members of the nights watch, they almost lead them to success. But the nights watch do their best with Jon Snow to defend it with every firing weapon they have but seems to be overwhelmed with the wildlings numbers. We see many people in the battle die with Jon Snow's closest allies. But at the very end Jon Snow sees the love of his life die in front of his eyes because of the battle they were put into. The battle ended with the nights watch winning and the rest of the wildlings retreating to the forest but in the end Jon Snow wanted to talk to the chief of the wildlings to convince them to set aside their differences and join together to defeat the real enemy, The Night King and his army of the Dead.    </strong> </p>
